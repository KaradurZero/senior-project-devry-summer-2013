Name: David Fairweather

Project Role:
Programmer

Bio:
I was born in Shell Beach, California. I enrolled at DeVry University and moved to Fremont in the Summer of 2010 after I earned 
an Associates of Science in General Studies at Cuesta Community College. Long before I studied programming, I have been playing games since I was 4 years old. 
Playing games has been a big passion of mine, but after using a free trial of RPG Maker when I was 20 years old, I realize that making 
a game of my own is even more rewarding than playing and beating any game. However, because Cuesta College had little to no academic
support for Computer Science at the time, I was unable to learn anything about programming from that school. It wasn't until early 2010 that I
was able to find a school that can give me the help I need to become a skilled programmer. Once I graduate from DeVry University, I am determined to 
use these skills to become part of the game industry and have a successful career as a programmer.
