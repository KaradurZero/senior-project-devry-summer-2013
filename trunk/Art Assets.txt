Art Assets

Sprites of cars, power up and other track items
Sprites of cars (not top down, they'll be used for displaying cars in the menu)
Full Drawn landscapes(?)
Sound effects (for driving, shooting, shield, power ups, etc.)
Music (not required but it would be nice. preferably some kind of techno rock music. one for the menu, and one for each track we make.)

I can take care of sprites and other 2d art
